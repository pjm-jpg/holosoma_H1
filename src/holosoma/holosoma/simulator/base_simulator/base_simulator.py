class BaseSimulator:
    """Base class for robotic simulation environments.

    Provides a unified framework for simulation setup, environment creation, and control
    over robotic assets and simulation properties. Includes unified state accessors
    for cross-simulator compatibility.

    The unified interface abstracts differences between IsaacGym's flat tensor approach
    and IsaacSim's object-based tensors, providing consistent APIs for object state
    management across both simulators.

    Actor Concept
    -------------
    An "actor" in this simulation framework refers to any named physical entity
    that can be manipulated in the simulation. This includes:

    - **Robots**: Articulated bodies with controllable joints (e.g., "humanoid_robot")
    - **Objects**: Rigid bodies like tools, furniture, or obstacles (e.g., "hammer_tool", "workbench_table")
    - **Scene Elements**: Environmental objects loaded from scene files (e.g., "wall_001", "floor_plane")

    All actors have:
    - Unique string identifiers for name-based access
    - 6DOF pose (position + orientation) relative to their asset-defined origin
    - Physical properties (mass, collision geometry, material properties)
    - State information including velocities and accelerations

    **Important**: The pose reference point (origin) is **asset-dependent** and defined
    by the asset file (URDF, USD, etc.), not by the simulator framework. For example:
    - Robot origins might be at the base link center, pelvis, or foot contact point
    - Object origins could be at geometric center, bottom corner, or functional point

    Note that different simulation frameworks use varying terminology for actors e.g., objects,
    models, bodies, entities.

    This abstraction allows the same API to work with any physical entity in the simulation,
    whether it's a complex robot or a simple rigid body object, while respecting each
    asset's coordinate frame conventions.

    Important Implementation Notes
    ------------------------------
    **Actor Index Ordering**: Actor indices returned by get_actor_indices() may have
    different ordering between simulator implementations. Always get indices dynamically
    to maintain maximum simulator-agnostic code. Never assume or hardcode specific
    index values in task/environment code.

    **State Synchronization**:
    - IsaacGym: State changes applied immediately
    - IsaacSim: State changes can be deferred for batching (see write_state_updates)

    Examples
    --------
    **Unified Interface (Recommended)**:
    >>> # Works identically across both simulators
    >>> states = sim.get_actor_states(["obj0", "table"], env_ids)
    >>> sim.set_actor_states(["obj0", "table"], env_ids, new_states)

    **Direct Tensor-Like Access (Advanced)**:
    >>> # Always get indices dynamically on or after setup - don't hardcode values.
    >>> indices = sim.get_actor_indices(["robot", "obj0", "obj1"], env_ids)
    >>>
    >>> states = sim.all_root_states[indices]          # gather [len(indices), 13]
    >>> sim.all_root_states[indices] = new_states      # scatter
    >>> sim.write_state_updates()                      # Sync changes

    ``all_root_states`` is a duck-typed proxy (NOT a ``torch.Tensor``) spanning all actors
    (robot, scene, and individual objects), routing ``[indices]`` reads/writes through
    ``get/set_actor_states_by_index``. Supported surface: ``[indices]`` and
    ``[indices, column_slice]`` read/write, ``.shape``, ``.device``, ``.dtype``, ``.clone()``.
    Tensor-only methods (``.view``/``.reshape``/``.to``) and ``isinstance(_, torch.Tensor)`` are
    not supported.

    Passing it wholesale to ``set_actor_root_state_tensor`` writes the robot only (that method
    detects the proxy by identity). Use ``set_actor_states`` to write objects.

    **Anti-Pattern (Don't Do This)**:
    >>> # Never assume specific index values
    >>> indices = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2])  # WRONG - hardcoded indices
    >>> # Always get indices dynamically to remain simulator-agnostic
    >>> indices = sim.get_actor_indices(["robot", "obj0"], env_ids)

    **Batched Updates (Performance)**:
    >>> # Batch multiple updates for efficiency in IsaacSim
    >>> sim.set_actor_states(["obj0"], env_ids, states1, write_updates=False)
    >>> sim.set_actor_states(["obj1"], env_ids, states2, write_updates=False)
    >>> sim.write_state_updates()  # Single batch sync

        Usage Patterns
        --------------
        **Automatic sync (current default behavior):**
        >>> sim.set_actor_states(["obj0"], env_ids, states)  # Auto-synced

        **Manual batching for performance:**
        >>> sim.set_actor_states(["obj0"], env_ids, states1, write_updates=False)
        >>> sim.set_actor_states(["obj1"], env_ids, states2, write_updates=False)
        >>> sim.write_state_updates()  # Batch sync

        **Direct access via all_root_states (any actor, incl. "robot"):**
        >>> sim.all_root_states[indices] = new_states  # Direct modification
        >>> sim.write_state_updates()  # Sync changes

        Implementation Notes
        --------------------
        - **IsaacGym**: No-op, state changes are always applied immediately
        - **IsaacSim**: Flushes deferred updates via scene.write_data_to_sim()

        - Returns current simulation states, not initial/default poses

          linear AND angular velocity are WORLD-frame and the quaternion is xyzw, for every

          ``get_actor_initial_poses`` result feeds straight back in unchanged. Velocities are
          world-frame too (see :meth:`get_actor_states_by_names` for the 13-vector layout).
        - Need env-LOCAL coordinates? Convert at the call site (position columns only; quat and
          velocity are origin-invariant). For a name-major/env-minor tensor ``t`` over ``names`` x
          ``env_ids``: ``t[:, 0:3] -= self.env_origins[env_ids].repeat(len(names), 1)`` to go
          world->local, ``+=`` to go local->world. (No frame kwarg exists; poses are world-frame.)

        Important Notes
        ---------------
        **Index Ordering**: All backends share one convention, **name-major, env-minor**:
        for ``get_actor_indices(names, env_ids)`` the result groups all of ``names[0]``'s
        envs first, then ``names[1]``'s, etc. (matches ``ObjectRegistry.get_initial_poses_batch``).
        ``get_actor_states`` / ``set_actor_states`` rely on this, so a caller pairing
        ``get_actor_initial_poses`` with ``set_actor_states`` must group both the same way.

        **Best Practices**:
        - **Always get indices dynamically** - never assume specific index values
        - Use unified interface methods (get_actor_states, set_actor_states) when possible
        - Don't hardcode index values in task/environment code
        - Cache indices if used repeatedly in performance-critical code

        **Virtual Address Space**:
        Objects are organized by environment rather than by type for performance:

        [robot_env0, obj0_env0, obj1_env0, # env 0 objects
         robot_env1, obj0_env1, obj1_env1, # env 1 objects

        Notes
        -----
        Initial poses represent the "default" or "starting" configuration from:
        - Scene file object transforms
        - Individual object configuration positions
        - Robot initial state configuration

        These are NOT the current simulation poses - use get_actor_states() for current poses.

        Frame: the returned pose is **WORLD-frame (env_origins already applied) on every backend**,
        the same single convention as ``get_actor_states`` and ``set_actor_states``. Feed a
        ``get_actor_initial_poses`` result STRAIGHT into ``set_actor_states`` to reset (as the
        reset/jitter terms do); to place at a hand-built target, pass world coordinates directly.
        Never add ``env_origins`` yourself and never branch on simulator type.

        Parameters
        ----------
        env_ids : EnvIds | None, default=None
            Environment IDs to query (see EnvIds type). If None, applies to all environments.

            Format: positions and velocities (see simulator docs for indexing).
            If None, uses current dof_state.

        Examples
        --------
        See simulator-specific implementations for correct tensor format examples:

        - IsaacGym: `holosoma.simulator.isaacgym.IsaacGym.set_dof_state_tensor_robots`

        Notes
        -----
        - **Tensor shape inconsistency**: Different simulators expect different shapes
        - Joint positions should be within DOF limits
        - Joint velocities are typically set to zero for resets
        - Always check simulator-specific documentation for correct tensor format
